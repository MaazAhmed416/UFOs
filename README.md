# UFOs Analysis
## Purpose of the analysis
For this analysis, our purpose was to conduct a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by filtering the data by date,city,state,country and shape. Such a filtering tool helps the user conduct a more robust and easy analysis on UFO sightings.

## Results of the analysis
### Filtering the data
To perform the search, the user will first put in the date that will filter the data for the specific date. This shows what available data meets the criteria of the date. To further narrow down their search, the user will put in the city in which they are interested to see the UFO sightings for. To make their lives even easier, the user can further filter the data for the state they want to see the data for. Furthermore, they can also put in the country which will farther help them narrow down their search. Lastly, they can also filter the data by the shape of the UFO sighting. Morover, the user can also filter the data by however many elements they want, they don't necessarily have to filter the data for all five elements everytime.

## Summary of the analysis
### Drawback of the webpage
One drawback of the search is the credibility of the data. I believe it is very important to know who the citizen scientists are to further perform a credible and reliable analysis

### Recommendation for further development of the webpage
The data will be more reliable if we know who the citizen scientists are. Furthermore, the webpage should provide a little description of the individuals background and expertise which will help the data become more credible. Moreover, the webpage can include links to other webpages that provide more details of the different UFO sightings. A simple comment of the sighting is not enough to conduct a satisying and reliable analysis.
